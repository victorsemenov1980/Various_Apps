This is a fun experiment with moviepy library
This code in simple tKinter interface allows creating movie clips from background image, text and background music. 
Technically this is the basis for making a bulk processing code that will loop over multiple files.
Just in case there is a VoiceOver module that is making VoiceOver from the text and this audio file can also be encoded to be added to clip

Remark: don't forget to wright extension of the target file, like "test2021.mp4"
