This is a nice and convenient notebook for data analysis

Pretty often it is more convenient to analyse data directly from charts. I have made a notebook in Bokeh where from any csv you can build a chart and then look at it, analyse and select some area of special interest of strange behaviour.

Value of this notebook is in the possibility to save the selection in separate csv for future usage

I upload entire notebook with multiple charts and source csv. Change as you need ))
